# GooglePlusPlus Default Circle

## General Information
The `googleplusplus_default_circle` userscript / extension for Google Plus (aka Google+ aka G+) adds a star next to each circle stream name. The star can be clicked to set or unset one circle stream as your default. When a default is set, going to the Stream view (which is an aggregate of all your circles) you automatically get redirected to your default stream.

Effectively, you can make one of your circles as the new everything you want to see by default based on one circle not all circles.

So far, this userscript / extension was tested on Google Chrome 12 and Firefox 5 with [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) ([download](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748/)) and should also work in Safari with the plugin [NinjaKit](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/os0x/20100612/1276330696) ([download](http://ss-o.net/safari/extension/NinjaKit.safariextz)).

Feedback is welcome.
